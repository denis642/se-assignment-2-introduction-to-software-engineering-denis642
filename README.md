Waterfall model preferred for projects with clear, stable requirements and short term projects.
Agile model preferred for projects with evolving or unclear requirements.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering is the process of eliciting, analyzing, documenting, and managing the requirements for a software system.
The process involves:
i.	Elicitation- Gather requirements from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, workshops, and observation.
ii.	Analysis- Analyze the gathered requirements to identify inconsistencies, conflicts, ambiguities, and missing information.
iii.	Specification- Document the requirements in a clear, unambiguous, and complete manner using various techniques such as use cases, user stories, requirements documents, and prototypes.
iv.	Validation- Validate the requirements to ensure they accurately represent the needs of the stakeholders and are feasible and achievable within the constraints of the project.
v.	Management- Validate the requirements to ensure they accurately represent the needs of the stakeholders and are feasible and achievable within the constraints of the project.
Importance in software development.
1.	Understanding user needs- Requirements engineering ensures that the software system meets the needs and expectations of its intended users, leading to greater user satisfaction.
2.	Enabling traceability- Traceability between requirements and other project artifacts (such as design documents, test cases, and code) helps ensure that the software system is developed according to the specified requirements and can be traced back to their origin



Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design is the practice of breaking down a software system into smaller, self-contained modules or components, each responsible for a specific functionality or feature.
Modularity in software design improves maintainability by isolating changes, enhancing testing, and improving code understandability.
It also improves scalability by providing a flexible architecture, promoting component reusability, enabling parallel development, and supporting the evolution of the software system over time.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing-Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration testing-Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System testing-Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance testing- Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Testing is crucial in software development for detecting bugs, ensuring quality, validating requirements, preventing costly errors, improving user satisfaction, increasing confidence, supporting change and evolution, ensuring compliance, facilitating continuous improvement, and building trust among stakeholders.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems are software tools that manage changes to source code and other files over time. They track modifications to files, maintain a history of changes, and enable collaboration among developers working on the same project. 
They are important in software development for various reasons;
i.	Track changes-they allow developers to track changes made to files over time, including who made the changes and when they were made.
ii.	Backup and Recovery- serves as a backup mechanism by maintaining a history of changes to files. In case of accidental deletions or data loss, developers can restore previous versions of files from the repository.
iii.	Code review- they supports code review processes by providing mechanisms for reviewing changes made by developers before they are integrated into the main codebase. This helps maintain code quality and identify potential issues early.
Examples of popular version control system are;
Git
Git is a distributed version control system known for its speed, scalability, and flexibility. It allows for branching, merging, and distributed collaboration. Popular hosting platforms for Git repositories include GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
Features
Versioning: Track changes to files over time.
 Branching and Merging: Create branches for parallel development and merge changes back into the main branch.
Collaboration: Enable multiple developers to work on the same project concurrently.
 History: Maintain a history of changes with details of who made the changes and when.
Backup and Recovery: Serve as a backup mechanism and allow for restoring previous versions of files.
Code Review: Support code review processes by providing mechanisms for reviewing and discussing changes.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software project managers play a critical role in overseeing and coordinating software projects from inception to completion.
Their key responsibilities include;
 Project Planning and Scheduling: Develop project plans outlining tasks, timelines, resources, and milestones. Create schedules and allocate resources effectively to meet project objectives.
Stakeholder Management: Identify stakeholders, understand their needs and expectations, and manage their involvement throughout the project lifecycle. Communicate project progress, risks, and changes to stakeholders regularly.
Team Leadership and Management: Lead and motivate project teams, including developers, testers, designers, and other stakeholders. Provide guidance, support, and direction to ensure teams are productive and aligned with project goals.
Risk Management: Identify, assess, and mitigate risks that may impact project success. Develop risk management strategies and contingency plans to address potential issues and minimize their impact on the project.

They face various challenges, including scope creep, resource constraints, technical complexity, communication breakdowns, and changing requirements.
